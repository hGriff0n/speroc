Current Project State
  mutability => mutable-by-default [off-spec]
  types => impl: hardcoded, availability: standard-only, generics: no, inheritance: unk
    recognized => Int, Bool, ~Byte, ~Char
	...
  variables => unsupported
  functions => main-only
  annotations => ignored

Current Project Plan
  x86 Register Analysis/Instruction Issuance
    Improve register allocation
	Add in flag/tracking (see when a flag got set and match it to the register/value)
	Add in instruction issuance functions
  Basic Variables
  More Basic Types
  Extending Operators for basic types
  Type Inference
  Basic Mutability Tracking
  Basic Function Definition
  Basic Function Calling
  Error/Exception handling and reporting
  Improve system benchmark collection
  Improve command line interface collection
  ...
  Converting Operators into function calls [ <- Needs mutability checking and references ]
