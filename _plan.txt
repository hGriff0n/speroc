Current Project State
  mutability => mutable-by-default [off-spec]
  types => impl: hardcoded, availability: standard-only, generics: no, inheritance: unk
    recognized => Int, Bool, ~Byte, ~Char
	...
  variables => unsupported
  functions => main-only
  annotations => ignored

Current Project Plan
  Basic Operator Assembly (for int types)
  x86 Register Analysis
  Basic Variables
  More Basic Types
  Extending Operators for basic types
  Type Inference
  Basic Mutability Tracking
  Basic Function Definition
  Basic Function Calling
  Error/Exception handling and reporting
  Improve system benchmark collection
  Improve command line interface collection
  ...
  Converting Operators into function calls [ <- Needs mutability checking and references ]
