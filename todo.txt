Fix Spero
  How is concurrency going to be handled?
  Figure out the rules and abilities of pointers and manual memory
  Work on recombining the pattern and binding syntaxes (for simplicity)
    'mut' placement prevents them from being the same grammar
    Look into whether ADT decomposition should be allowed in the binding grammar
  Work on the semantics of wait and yield
    Find a way to put wait into the grammar so that 'match wait' is legal
  What about "accidental safe catching"?
    A function is accidentally left as "unsafe" by the programmer
    Later-on they specify a section of code as "safe" to catch one "unsafe"
      By accident this annotation also catches the accidental function
  Should a yield without an accompianing wait revert to a straight return
  How can types specify behavior for '()' operator

Fixes Waiting for Other Features
  In-place modification of containers using for loops/iterators
    Waiting for: Implementation of standard containers and iterators

Work on ast construction
